# Linguist Data Directory

This directory contains vendored copies of GitHub Linguist YAML files:
- languages.yml: Extension → language mapping, interpreter names, language metadata
- heuristics.yml: Disambiguation rules for ambiguous extensions
- vendor.yml: Paths to exclude from detection (node_modules, vendor, etc.)

These files are fetched from: https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist

Update process:
1. Fetch latest files from Linguist repository
2. Place in this directory
3. No code changes required - detection logic loads these files directly
